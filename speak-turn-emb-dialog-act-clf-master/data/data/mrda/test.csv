1,huh.,1,8,-1,-1,-1
1,this is on popcorn or something?,4,6,-1,-1,-1
0,you just doing it all with complex arithmetic.,0,9,-1,-1,-1
0,and that works fine.,0,6,-1,-1,-1
0,um,3,10,-1,-1,-1
0,it's like,2,0,-1,-1,-1
1,uhhuh.,1,5,-1,-1,-1
1,but uh what did you think about the possibility of using the javier software?,4,4,-1,-1,-1
0,you would send i mean uh a transcriber is used i mean i don't know assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting.,0,3,-1,-1,-1
1,that's true.,0,3,-1,-1,-1
0,so,3,8,-1,-1,-1
0,we'll have a fair amount of annoyance.,0,3,-1,-1,-1
1,hopefully.,0,0,-1,-1,-1
0,and they can give some nice talks and stuff.,0,0,-1,-1,-1
0,so looking at the data where you know what's the what's what's what's characteristic.,0,7,-1,-1,-1
1,well it's okay.,0,3,-1,-1,-1
1,that's right.,0,8,-1,-1,-1
0,but we did not really look at what's happening and where is the noise and,2,7,-1,-1,-1
0,it does seem like it's more logical to combine them first.,0,8,-1,-1,-1
1,but,3,10,-1,-1,-1
1,that would be quick.,0,6,-1,-1,-1
1,or,3,8,-1,-1,-1
0,and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying.,0,2,-1,-1,-1

1,which is why i,2,1,-1,-1,-1
1,right.,1,0,-1,-1,-1
0,yeah.,3,8,-1,-1,-1
1,but i mean in the practical sense it's impossible.,0,1,-1,-1,-1
1,so let me try to understand.,0,8,-1,-1,-1
1,uh that is an interesting point.,0,3,-1,-1,-1
0,i mean i'm worried if you can't lock a file this this to me sounds very scary.,0,5,-1,-1,-1
1,so actually um at some point we should update and rescore everything with you know the corrected transcripts.,0,6,-1,-1,-1
0,and and,3,9,-1,-1,-1
