0,no matter what format you choose you're going to have the you're going to have the difficulty of relating the the frame level features.,0,0,-1,-1,-1
1,no it's backward forward.,0,26,-1,-1,-1
0,okay.,0,33,-1,-1,-1
1,what new hardware?,4,28,-1,-1,-1
0,and so.,3,43,-1,-1,-1
0,um do we have people write summaries?,4,50,-1,-1,-1
0,and i looked at one of them which was about ten sentences found fifteen twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on.,0,6,-1,-1,-1
0,um the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that um transcribers can do like dialogue act tagging.,0,17,-1,-1,-1
1,the medical.,0,47,-1,-1,-1
0,what's what's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way.,0,32,-1,-1,-1
1,wasn't there wasn't there some result andreas?,4,21,-1,-1,-1
1,oh that's fine.,0,13,-1,-1,-1
0,so i'm just playing around.,0,42,-1,-1,-1
0,yeah.,1,43,-1,-1,-1
1,we're,2,36,-1,-1,-1
1,um maybe for part of the meeting we don't have to do it the whole meeting.,0,14,-1,-1,-1
1,uh the close channel?,4,36,-1,-1,-1
0,if you take the standard model of channel plus noise uh it's it's a nonlinear uh transformation in the cepstral domain.,0,41,-1,-1,-1
1,twenty two twenty twenty two percent better than the old baseline.,0,40,-1,-1,-1
0,that's why.,0,26,-1,-1,-1
1,but i do think that the it'll turn out that it's going to be depend pretty much on whether there's been an override.,0,8,-1,-1,-1
0,we sent them the transcripts that correspond to those six meetings.,0,26,-1,-1,-1
1,oh well okay first of all it's not objects.,0,4,-1,-1,-1
0,for most.,2,15,-1,-1,-1
0,so it has also a delay.,0,35,-1,-1,-1
1,you know,2,46,-1,-1,-1
1,huh.,1,46,-1,-1,-1
0,you know.,0,6,-1,-1,-1
1,okay.,0,7,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah.,0,47,-1,-1,-1
1,what did we have?,4,15,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah.,1,14,-1,-1,-1
0,uhhuh.,1,2,-1,-1,-1
1,like probably if we had to hire some like an undergrad because uh don is being covered half time on something else.,0,16,-1,-1,-1
1,end of next week.,0,8,-1,-1,-1
1,so i'm not sure i'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance.,0,46,-1,-1,-1
1,landay?,4,31,-1,-1,-1
0,and maybe nothing is available.,0,29,-1,-1,-1
0,or it might limit it certainly constrains the possibilities of focus.,0,9,-1,-1,-1
1,would be helpful.,0,28,-1,-1,-1
1,not on the meeting.,0,15,-1,-1,-1
0,maybe more a few topic and items we will focus in the next days until the next meeting.,0,30,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah.,1,4,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah.,1,26,-1,-1,-1
0,and it isn't it isn't that,2,15,-1,-1,-1
0,so we have uh to try to get rid of these this problem.,0,46,-1,-1,-1
0,does does the wireless thing work on your,2,12,-1,-1,-1
1,who?,4,50,-1,-1,-1
0,just just the l.d.a. filters.,0,41,-1,-1,-1
0,that person just wants to take a picture because he just bought film.,0,5,-1,-1,-1
0,we've been uh contacted by university of washington now of course to um,2,26,-1,-1,-1
0,uh we'll want to distinguish stress as a form device.,0,9,-1,-1,-1
0,should we just make some?,4,4,-1,-1,-1
1,it's as soon as we get labels yep.,0,14,-1,-1,-1
1,and i think uh if we could get,2,17,-1,-1,-1
0,and we know that navigational tasks are going to be a core domain of the new system.,0,1,-1,-1,-1
0,it's clear where where we are right now.,0,4,-1,-1,-1
1,do you you do a k l t transform on the combined feature vector?,4,23,-1,-1,-1
0,so so there there are some some uh you know uh elaborations of this.,0,10,-1,-1,-1
1,no.,0,43,-1,-1,-1
0,i mean we have the framenet group here.,0,1,-1,-1,-1
1,two is good.,0,33,-1,-1,-1
0,but um i don't know i i would i would guess that you'd,2,45,-1,-1,-1
1,and and in in the in the previous version where in the which is used now there the backchannel would would be in between there somewhere.,0,21,-1,-1,-1
0,but one of uh where you really want that the packet went through put it in the i.p. header.,0,30,-1,-1,-1
0,so,3,43,-1,-1,-1
1,beep.,0,28,-1,-1,-1
0,we can we can tell which training set gives the best result.,0,33,-1,-1,-1
0,one is the technical one that you don't wind up with such big exponential uh c b t's.,0,4,-1,-1,-1
0,so i think ultimately we'll wind up doing some normalization.,0,45,-1,-1,-1
0,but the way it's combined is maybe done,2,42,-1,-1,-1
0,right?,4,22,-1,-1,-1
0,there was this big d d c offset.,0,42,-1,-1,-1
1,so,3,45,-1,-1,-1
0,and i'll get three or four of these pairs.,0,41,-1,-1,-1
1,well that's that's that's true too.,0,16,-1,-1,-1
1,okay.,0,6,-1,-1,-1
0,and so there are more insertions.,0,28,-1,-1,-1
0,too much file transfer and stuff.,0,41,-1,-1,-1
1,okay.,0,35,-1,-1,-1
1,okay.,0,30,-1,-1,-1
1,as long as it's clear.,0,15,-1,-1,-1
1,so i think there are a variety of things in which um,2,6,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah.,1,24,-1,-1,-1
1,uhhuh.,1,37,-1,-1,-1
0,maybe there's more potential.,0,29,-1,-1,-1
0,i think it may almost have to do with like okay.,0,48,-1,-1,-1
1,well i mean it's,2,46,-1,-1,-1
0,so one thing you could do is build a little system that said whenever you got a question like that i've got one of three answers.,0,1,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah.,1,17,-1,-1,-1
1,but just has another pronunciation.,0,20,-1,-1,-1
1,it,2,48,-1,-1,-1
1,right.,1,21,-1,-1,-1
1,right.,1,40,-1,-1,-1
1,right.,1,47,-1,-1,-1
1,yeah well we can skip the digits.,0,26,-1,-1,-1
1,um i remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non vocal sounds.,0,49,-1,-1,-1
1,um just log out.,0,30,-1,-1,-1
0,uh,3,41,-1,-1,-1
1,okay.,0,8,-1,-1,-1
